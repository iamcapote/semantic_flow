Licensor: The Semantic Flow authors (led by iamcapote)

Non‑normative summary (for convenience only; the legal terms below control):
- Internal Business Use (self‑hosted, for your own org only): free, source‑available.
- Customer‑Facing Use (SaaS/managed service/public API/etc.): two simultaneous obligations are required:
	(1) Paid Enterprise/Commercial License from Licensor; and
	(2) Open‑source the complete “Service Source Code” you use to offer the service (SSPL‑style obligation).
- Only entities that both pay the fee and comply with the Service Source Code obligation are eligible to host Semantic Flow for third parties (“Authorized Hosting Eligibility”).
- No commercial redistribution (selling/licensing distributions) without a commercial license.
- Source‑available “fair‑code”; NOT an OSI‑approved open source license.
- Patents: protective patent grant with termination on patent aggression.

2. Grant of Rights for Internal Business Use (no fee)
Subject to Your compliance with this License:
2.1 You are granted a worldwide, royalty‑free, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, non‑sublicensable license to:
		(a) use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the Software for Internal Business Use; and
		(b) create, use, and maintain Derivative Works for Internal Business Use; and
		(c) non‑commercially redistribute unmodified source copies of the Software solely for non‑commercial, non‑customer‑facing purposes, provided You retain this License and all notices.
2.2 Any rights not expressly granted in Section 2 are reserved by the Licensor.

3. Customer‑Facing Use and Commercial Redistribution (eligibility and paid license)
3.1 You may not engage in Customer‑Facing Use or Commercial Redistribution of the Software or any Derivative Works unless and until You are an Authorized Host.
3.2 To become an Authorized Host, You must: (i) obtain and maintain a current Enterprise/Commercial License; (ii) comply with Section 5 (Service Source Code obligations); and (iii) comply with Section 6 (Hosting and Security Guidelines and disclosures).
3.3 Examples (non‑exhaustive):
		- OK (no fee): Self‑hosted internal analytics for Your employees; internal demos that do not serve external users.
		- Requires authorization (paid + open source): Public SaaS built on Semantic Flow; managed hosting for customers; exposing APIs powered by Semantic Flow to external users; bundling Semantic Flow into a paid product.

4. No Commercial Redistribution by Default
Outside of an Enterprise/Commercial License, You may not commercially redistribute the Software or Derivative Works, including without limitation:
		(a) selling access, licenses, or subscriptions that include or rely upon the Software; or
		(b) offering paid consulting or integration that results in ongoing third‑party access to the Software’s functionality; or
		(c) re‑licensing or sublicensing the Software or Derivative Works for consideration.

5. Service Source Code obligation for Customer‑Facing Use (SSPL‑style)
5.1 Condition. As a condition to any Customer‑Facing Use, You must make the complete, corresponding Service Source Code publicly available under this same License (SFL) at no charge.
5.2 Timing. You must publish the Service Source Code:
		(a) within 30 days of first making the service available to any third party; and
		(b) within 30 days of any material change thereafter.
5.3 Completeness. The Service Source Code must be sufficient for a skilled person to build, deploy, and run a service that is functionally equivalent to the one You make available, excluding only the items in Section 1.8(a)–(c).
5.4 Location and Notices. Host the Service Source Code in a publicly accessible source repository and include: (i) this License text; (ii) a NOTICE file identifying Your changes; and (iii) clear instructions to build and operate the service.
5.5 License for contributions. Service Source Code You publish must be licensed under SFL; You may not impose further restrictions that would prevent others from exercising rights granted by this License.
5.6 Interoperation. Publishing the Service Source Code does not waive the requirement to maintain a current Enterprise/Commercial License for Customer‑Facing Use.

6. Hosting and Security Guidelines; anti‑fraud disclosures
6.1 Compliance. Authorized Hosts must follow the Hosting and Security Guidelines published by the Licensor, including minimum security, transparency, and user protection standards intended to prevent scams and misuse.
6.2 Deployment disclosures. Authorized Hosts must provide users with: (a) a link to the source repository for the Service Source Code; (b) a link to the official Semantic Flow repository and documentation; and (c) a clear statement whether the host is “Official” (authorized by Licensor to use Licensor trademarks for this purpose) or “Unofficial”.
6.3 “Official” claims. You may not claim to be “official,” “certified,” or similar unless expressly authorized in writing by the Licensor. Trademark use is governed by Section 9.

7. Modifications and Contributions
7.1 You may create Derivative Works for Internal Business Use under Section 2.
7.2 If You publicly distribute Derivative Works in source form on a non‑commercial basis, You must retain this License, copyright notices, and a NOTICE file identifying changes, and license such Derivative Works under this same License (SFL) with no additional restrictions.
7.3 Customer‑Facing Use or commercial distribution of Derivative Works requires Authorized Host status.

8. Patent Grant and Termination (Apache‑style)
8.1 Subject to this License, the Licensor grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive, no‑charge, royalty‑free, irrevocable (except as stated here) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software, for Internal Business Use only.
8.2 If You or Your affiliate initiate patent litigation (including a cross‑claim or counterclaim) alleging that the Software or a Derivative Work infringes a patent, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

9. Trademarks and “Official” status
9.1 This License does not grant permission to use the Licensor’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Software and reproducing the NOTICE file.
9.2 Use of “Semantic Flow,” related marks, or “Official”/“Certified” designations in connection with hosting or services requires a separate written authorization from the Licensor.

10. Relationship to Open Source; SSPL/Apache inspiration
10.1 This License is a source‑available “fair‑code” license and is not approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).
10.2 It is not the Apache License 2.0 nor the Server Side Public License (SSPL). It is inspired by Apache 2.0’s permissive internal‑use terms and by SSPL’s focus on network/service deployments. Unlike SSPL, this License additionally requires a paid Enterprise/Commercial License for Customer‑Facing Use.

11. Eligibility; verification
11.1 Eligibility to host. Only Authorized Hosts may offer Customer‑Facing Use of the Software.
11.2 Attestation. At the Licensor’s reasonable request, You will provide a written attestation of Your current usage model (internal vs. customer‑facing), a link to Your published Service Source Code (if applicable), and confirmation of Hosting and Security Guidelines compliance.
11.3 Audit. Licensor may verify compliance by reviewing publicly available materials. Licensor will not request confidential information beyond what is reasonably necessary to confirm compliance.

12. Termination; cure
12.1 This License automatically terminates if You materially breach it and fail to cure within thirty (30) days of receiving written notice from the Licensor.
12.2 Upon termination, the rights granted in Sections 2 and 8 cease immediately. Provisions that by their nature should survive (including Sections 6–16) shall survive termination.
12.3 The Licensor may reinstate Your rights upon adequate cure at its discretion.

13. Disclaimer of Warranty
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS USE.

14. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE LICENSOR FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (US$100).

15. Indemnity
You will indemnify and hold harmless the Licensor from and against any third‑party claims arising from Your Customer‑Facing Use or Commercial Redistribution performed in violation of this License.

16. Governing Law; Venue
Unless otherwise required by law, this License is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of the Licensor’s principal place of business, excluding its conflict‑of‑law rules. The exclusive venue for disputes shall be the courts located in that jurisdiction.

17. New versions
The Licensor may publish new versions of this License with a new version number; unless You agree otherwise, Your existing rights continue under the version in effect when You obtained the Software.

18. Commercial licensing contact
For Enterprise/Commercial License inquiries (required for Customer‑Facing Use or Commercial Redistribution), contact the repository maintainers via GitHub Issues or profile email.

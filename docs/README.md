2. Pages Overview (`pages/overview.md`) – what each area is for.
3. Providers (`providers.md`) – selecting models and controlling prompt injection.
4. Ontology (`ontology/overview.md`) – node types, clusters, why they matter.
5. Node Context (`ontology/node-context.md`) – how a node becomes structured text.
6. Text → Workflow (`features/text-to-workflow.md`) – drafting from prose.
7. Node Enhancement (`features/node-enhancement.md`) – polishing individual nodes.
8. Workflow Execution (`features/workflow-execution.md`) – sequential run behavior.
9. Runtime Execution Model (`execution.md`) – prompt shaping and progress events.
10. Export / Import (`export-import.md`) – formats and practical export uses.
11. Security (`security.md`) – key handling and local storage surfaces.
12. FAQ (`faq.md`) – concise answers to recurring usage questions.

Cross‑reference: When in Chat and unsure how injection works, read Providers. When deciding node granularity, read Ontology and Node Context.

# Text → Workflow

Purpose: accelerate initial graph creation from a descriptive specification.

Usage:
1. Navigate to the API / Router tab.
2. Locate the Text → Workflow input area.
3. Paste a concise, information‑dense description: goals, actors, constraints, key artifacts, evaluation criteria.
4. Run conversion; a preliminary workflow is produced.
5. Review each node: delete irrelevant or duplicated nodes immediately.
6. Normalize titles to a consistent tense and casing.
7. Add or adjust edges to reflect genuine conceptual references.

Effective input characteristics:
* Declarative sentences identifying roles and responsibilities.
* Explicit constraints and success metrics.
* Segmented bullet lists rather than freeform narrative.

Post‑generation refinement:
Merge nodes that only differ by minor wording. Split nodes that contain more than one actionable concept. Introduce missing evaluation or risk nodes where necessary to complete reasoning loops.

Limits:
Edge inference is approximate; expect manual correction. Extraneous invented categories can appear—remove them. Very long unstructured prose reduces accuracy; pre‑structure with headings or bullets when possible.

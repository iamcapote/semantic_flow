# Semantic Flow — To‑Do and Change Log

A living checklist for refactors, GUI redesign, and build fixes. Append new entries at the bottom with UTC timestamps.

## Open Tasks
- [ ] Tests: smoke + unit coverage for new modules (Builder95, DiscourseConfig)
- [ ] Bridge Builder95 workflow <-> IDE/Console DSL (import/export mapping)
- [ ] CSV export option in Export Modal and exportUtils (table views for audits)
- [ ] Provider-integrated Chat (replace local mock with provider-backed chat route)
- [ ] Template gallery for common schemas (personas, API packs, research kits)
- [ ] Importers for popular prompt libraries
- [ ] Optional local persistence adapters and export jobs
- [ ] Tool registry UI and connector templates
- [ ] Access‑controlled sharing of schemas (read‑only links)

## In-Process Validating Tasks
- [X] Theme controls: background/node color customization in Flow (Win95) builder

## Notes
- Do not remove existing features; reorganize safely.
- BYOK remains: keys only in session storage (encrypted), never persisted.
